# Kong API Catalog Harvester

## Description

Kong plugin to harvest your API catalog. Turn actual API traffic into valuable data. 

## Key Objectives

- Provide a way to collect & reconstruct an API catalog.
- Provide a way to feed a data catalog service to govern the data being processed by your APIs.
- Turn actual API traffic into an API specification for your service.
- Detect API changes and check conformance from your live services.
- Track sensitive data flows

## Getting Started

How this is working ?

The end to end testing works as follow 

- From a sample specification (aka the Swagger Pet Store) we generate a collection with Postman 
- A Newman runtime will be used to execute the collection
- From a sample specification (aka the Swagger Pet Store) we generate a mock with Prism
- Kong will route the newman API request to the Stoplight Prism mock
- This plugin will harvest a specification based on the captured API traffic

Build the required images

``` bash
docker-compose build
```

Run the stack

``` bash
docker-compose up
```

## Goal

The aim of this plugin is to create a way to extract relevant data from Kong in order to be processed externally.
