# Kong API Catalog Harvester

## Description

Kong plugin to harvest your API catalog. Turn actual API traffic into valuable data. 

## Key Objectives

- Provide a way to collect & reconstruct an API catalog.
- Provide a way to feed a data catalog service to govern the data being processed by your APIs.
- Turn actual API traffic into an API specification for your service.
- Detect API changes and check conformance from your live services.
- Track sensitive data flows

## Getting Started

How is this working ?

To demonstrate the API harvesting through our plugin we have created an end-to-end testing Docker compose that put the following into action.

- From a given sample API specification (aka the Swagger Pet Store) we generate a collection with Postman 
- A Docker Newman runtime will be used to execute the collection
- From the same sample API specification, we generate an API mock with Stoplight Prism
- Kong will route the generated API request to the mock
- This plugin will harvest a specification based on the captured API traffic

In the `repository` folder you will find the harvested API specification and in the `snapshots` you will find the learning path of this plugin.
A new API snapshot being created each time an update is provided by the harvesting.

Build the required images

``` bash
docker-compose build
```

Run the stack

``` bash
docker-compose up
```

Debug the stack

``` bash
docker-compose  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-debug.yml build
```

``` bash
docker-compose  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-debug.yml up
```

Then attach your remote Go debugger to localhost:40000 !

See below end-to-end test execution

## Goal

The aim of this plugin is to create a way to extract relevant data from Kong in order to be processed externally.
